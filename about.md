From [Holling, C. S. Resilience and Stability of Ecological Systems. Annu. Rev. Ecol. Syst. 4, 1â€“23 (1973).](https://www.annualreviews.org/docserver/fulltext/ecolsys/4/1/annurev.es.04.110173.000245.pdf?expires=1723061613&id=id&accname=ar-271826&checksum=44C08A36BDB1AB1AF38727827D2ADE11):

>Resilience determines the persistence of relationships within a system and is a measure of the ability of these systems to absorb changes of state variables, driving variables, and parameters, and still persist.

This definition emphasizes resilience as an inherent system property rather than focusing solely on stability or recovery speed. 
Our project will refine this concept into a mathematically precise, quantifiable definition applicable across sociobiological scales.

The team of researchers will be organized into five interconnected clusters:

1.	Scale-free Theoretical Studies on Resilience
2.	Ecological and Environmental Sciences
3.	Biological and Evolutionary Sciences
4.	Applied and Integrative Sciences
5.	Synthesis

Cluster 1 - Scale-free Theoretical Studies on Resilience

This cluster aims to formalise the definitions of the terminology often used in terms of resilience and, where possible, investigate the origins and development of these concepts in an evolutionary sense.
Concepts such as Redundancy, Plasticity/Elasticity, Rigidity/Fragility,
Negative feedback,
Self-organisation, Memory/hysteresis, Persistence, Tipping points and Criticality

Cluster 2 -  Ecological and Environmental Sciences

The concept of resilience has a long history in ecology.

Cluster 3 -  Biological and Evolutionary Sciences

The concept of resilience has a long history in ecology.

Cluster 4 - Applied and Integrative Sciences

Socialbiological evolution and sociotechnological advances

Cluster 2 -  Synthesis

The philosophies of resilience across scales.
