From [Holling, C. S. Resilience and Stability of Ecological Systems. Annu. Rev. Ecol. Syst. 4, 1â€“23 (1973).](https://www.annualreviews.org/docserver/fulltext/ecolsys/4/1/annurev.es.04.110173.000245.pdf?expires=1723061613&id=id&accname=ar-271826&checksum=44C08A36BDB1AB1AF38727827D2ADE11):

>Resilience determines the persistence of relationships within a system and is a measure of the ability of these systems to absorb changes of state variables, driving variables, and parameters, and still persist.

This definition emphasizes resilience as an inherent system property rather than focusing solely on stability or recovery speed. 
Our project will refine this concept into a mathematically precise, quantifiable definition applicable across sociobiological scales.

The team of researchers will be organized into five interconnected clusters:

1.	Scale-free Theoretical Studies on Resilience
2.	Ecological and Environmental Sciences
3.	Biological and Evolutionary Sciences
4.	Applied and Integrative Sciences
5.	Synthesis



### Cluster 1 - Scale-free Theoretical Studies on Resilience

This cluster aims to formalise the definitions of the terminology often used in terms of resilience and, where possible, investigate the origins and development of these concepts in an evolutionary sense.
Concepts such as Redundancy, Plasticity/Elasticity, Rigidity/Fragility,
Negative feedback,
Self-organisation, Memory/hysteresis, Persistence, Tipping points and Criticality


### Cluster 2 -  Ecological and Environmental Sciences**

The concept of ecological resilience


### Cluster 3 -  Biological and Evolutionary Sciences

The concept of biological resilience and evolutionary resilience


### Cluster 4 - Applied and Integrative Sciences

Resilience engineering in sociobiological and cultural evolution and socio-technological advances


### Cluster 5 -  Synthesis

The aim of this cluster is to synthesise the philosophies of resilience across scales of organisation. If we want to make a impact on a planetary scale - combining our viewpoints - from theoretical developments to practical applications - needs to be synthesised. This cluster will delve into providing such coherent perspectives and review documentation of the project.
