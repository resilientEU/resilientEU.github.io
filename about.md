Marie Skłodowska-Curie Doctoral Networks (MSCDN) are aimed at integrating institutions across different sectors throughout Europe, building a network that extends across Europe and connects with academic and nonacademic organisations worldwide -https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/actions/doctoral-networks

As an ongoing example of MSCDN, check out EvoGamesPlus (https://evogamesplus.eu/), which we are a part of.


*Please read the following carefully. It will help you position your project within the framework.*


Resilience - Doctoral Network spanning the European Union focused on formalizing, implementing and synthesizing the concept of Resilience

From [Holling, C. S. Resilience and Stability of Ecological Systems. Annu. Rev. Ecol. Syst. 4, 1–23 (1973).](https://www.annualreviews.org/docserver/fulltext/ecolsys/4/1/annurev.es.04.110173.000245.pdf?expires=1723061613&id=id&accname=ar-271826&checksum=44C08A36BDB1AB1AF38727827D2ADE11):

>Resilience determines the persistence of relationships within a system and is a measure of the ability of these systems to absorb changes of state variables, driving variables, and parameters, and still persist.

This definition emphasises resilience as an inherent system property rather than focusing solely on stability or recovery speed. 
Our project will refine this concept into a mathematically precise, quantifiable definition applicable across sociobiological scales.

We have experience applying for MSCDN and are currently a part of the Doctoral Network [EvoGamesPlus](https://evogamesplus.eu) in the _Mathematics panel.
**The proposal will be submitted to the Mathematics (MAT) scientific panel of the HORIZON-MSCA, hence the mainstay of the projects will be mathematical and theoretical in nature.**


The team of researchers will be organised into five interconnected clusters:

1.	Scale-free Theoretical Studies on Resilience
2.	Ecological and Environmental Sciences
3.	Biological and Evolutionary Sciences
4.	Applied and Integrative Sciences
5.	Synthesis



#### Cluster 1 - Scale-free Theoretical Studies on Resilience

This cluster aims to mathematically formalise the definitions of the terminology often used in terms of resilience and, where possible, investigate the origins and development of these concepts in an evolutionary sense.
Concepts such as *Redundancy, Plasticity/Elasticity, Rigidity/Fragility, feedback loops, self-organisation, memory/hysteresis, persistence, tipping points, and criticality* will be defined and studied using methods from mathematics, dynamical systems theory, and statistical physics.


#### Cluster 2 -  Ecological and Environmental Sciences

This cluster will focus on developing and applying mathematical and dynamical systems theories to model and predict ecological and environmental resilience. 
The researchers will leverage concepts from nonlinear dynamics, bifurcation theory, and complex systems; the project aims to identify critical thresholds (tipping points) within ecosystems that signal potential transitions from stable to unstable states. The projects will provide insights into the mechanisms driving ecosystem resilience or vulnerability, facilitating the development of strategies to enhance ecological stability and sustainability in the face of climate change, habitat loss, and other anthropogenic pressures.


#### Cluster 3 -  Biological and Evolutionary Sciences

This cluster will explore the resilience of biological systems and evolutionary processes. 
The role of genetic diversity, adaptation, and evolutionary pressures in maintaining resilience will be explored by focusing on how organisms and populations respond to environmental stressors over evolutionary time. 
The researchers will use population genetics, population dynamics models, stochastic processes, and evolutionary game theory to investigate how resilience is maintained or lost at different biological scales, from cellular to population levels. The research will also examine how evolutionary strategies influence the ability of species to recover from perturbations, adapt to changing environments, and avoid (promote) extinction (in cases of dysbiosis via infections, cancers, pests etc.). 
The goal is to provide a comprehensive theoretical understanding of the mechanisms that drive biological resilience, offering insights into conservation strategies and biodiversity management in the face of rapid environmental changes.


#### Cluster 4 - Applied and Integrative Sciences

This cluster will investigate the resilience of sociobiological systems, cultural evolution, and socio-technological systems. 
By examining how social behaviours, cultural norms, and technological innovations evolve and adapt over time, the researchers involved will explore the factors that contribute to the resilience of societies in the face of challenges such as environmental changes, resource depletion, and technological disruptions. 
Tools like agent-based models, evolutionary game theory, and network theory will be used to understand how social networks, cultural practices, and technological systems can maintain stability and adapt to changing conditions. Positive (and negative) feedback loops between social behaviours and technological advancements influence the resilience of human societies. Insights gained from this cluster could inform strategies for fostering social and technological resilience to ensure societies can adapt to and thrive amidst rapid cultural and technological changes.


#### Cluster 5 -  Synthesis

This cluster aims to synthesise the philosophies of resilience across organisational scales. 
Combining our viewpoints - from theoretical developments to practical applications - needs to be synthesised to make an impact on a planetary scale.
The involved researchers will explore commonalities and differences in how resilience manifests across these varied contexts by integrating mathematical approaches such as dynamical systems theory, network analysis, and evolutionary game theory. 
The goal is to identify universal principles that govern resilience, such as feedback mechanisms, tipping points, and adaptive capacities, and connect back to the scale-free concepts to develop a unified theory that can be applied to predict and enhance resilience in complex systems. 
The project will also investigate how resilience at one level (e.g., cellular or organismal) impacts resilience at higher organizational scales (e.g., ecosystems or societies). 
By combining insights across clusters in ecology, evolutionary biology, sociobiology, cultural evolution, and socio-technological systems, this synthesis will provide a robust theoretical foundation for understanding and managing resilience in a rapidly changing world.
