We are currently soliciting interested researchers to join the Doctoral network application process.

**The below definitions can be found in the EU documents [EU documents](https://resilienteu.github.io/literature/2024/08/02/EUDocuments.html)**

To check if your organisation is eligible or not, please refer to this [EU site](https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/actions/doctoral-networks/6-steps-to-prepare-your-application)

There are two kinds of roles possible:


### *Beneficiary*

The legal entities that sign the grant agreement (either directly or through an accession form) and have the responsibility for the proper implementation of the action.
They contribute directly to the implementation of the research, transfer of knowledge and training activities.
Applications must be submitted by a consortium including at least three independent legal entities, each established in a
different EU Member State or Horizon Europe Associated Country and with at least one of them established in an EU
Member State. Should none of them be entitled to award a doctoral degree, a university or a consortium/grouping of
academic/research institutions entitled to award a doctoral degree must be added to the project as an associated partner or
an associated partner linked to a beneficiary.

Beneficiaries can be from the 

* Academic sectors - means public or private higher education establishments awarding academic degrees, public or private non-profit research organisations 81 and International European Research Organisations (IERO)

or

* Non-academic sectors - means any socio-economic actor not included in the academic sector and fulfilling the requirements of the Horizon Europe Rules for Participation.

### *Associated partners*

Entities which participate in the action but without the right to
charge costs or claim contributions. 
They contribute to implementing the action but do not sign the grant agreement. 
Associated partners may not employ the researchers who are under the action.

There are regulations about the consortium composition (maximum members per EU country, number of countries etc.).
Furthermore, we are also interested in the fit within the theme of the framework and have already envisioned associations between potential network members.

Considering this, we have compiled a short Letter of Interest template.



## Letter of Interest

Please fill out the following letter of interest that will allow us to assess your interest and determine if it fits with the framework concept (see About) and the interests of other applicants.
Feel free to send this information to collaborators (as per rules for beneficiaries or associated) if you see them fit in this program and possibly develop joint doctorate programs that preferably go across clusters.

Once assessed, we will form collaborative research teams and a core writing group to proceed with the application writing.
Hence, while we appreciate your time and effort in being a part of the application process, we are limited in how many *Beneficiaries* we can have and a justified reasonable number of *Associated partners*

**Funding area:** - [Please choose one main area](https://resilienteu.github.io/about.html) -- Scale-free theories (specific mathematical concept?), Scale specific (which specifically?), Synthesis (across which disciplines?) 

**Applicant information:** Primary applicant (Name, Position, Affiliation), supporting applicant (mandatory person from the same organisation as a fallback)

**Partner information:** Have you already identified a partner who is also applying to this network?

**Title (150 characters)**
- The Project Title should, concisely and in non-technical terms, convey the essence of your proposed project.

**Executive summary (1500 characters, including spaces and punctuation)**

**Project description (4000 characters including spaces and punctuation)**
 - This section includes the technical details of the proposed Doctoral project, connections/planned visits to potential academic partners in other EU & EU-associated countries, and how the visits will complement the completion of the Doctoral studies.

*Applied aspect (if any)* and connections to non-academic partners (1500 characters including spaces and punctuation)  
The doctoral network aims to promote international, inter-sectoral, and multi/inter-disciplinary collaboration in doctoral-level training in Europe. They also aim to train highly skilled doctoral candidates and stimulate entrepreneurship, creativity, and innovation in Europe and beyond. Recommend non-academic partners that resonate with the theme of resilience and sustainability in the industry and connect to the topic/methodology of the proposed Doctoral project.

**Statement of significance (1000 characters including spaces and punctuation)**
What is the state of the art of the topic of the Doctoral project about the themes of resilience? how is the project advancing it?
